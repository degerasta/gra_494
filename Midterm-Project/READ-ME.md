# Midterm Project - Monday.com Re-designed Landing Page

## Project Description

This site builds off of the previous exercises within the midterm project: atomic design principles, css methodologies, and component libraries. Pulling content and copy from monday.com, I am displaying a mock landing page for the company with css styles and markup that I established in the personalized style guide.
